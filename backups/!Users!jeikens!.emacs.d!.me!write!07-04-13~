It is the Fourth of July, and I am sitting in the subletted room of a five-year-old in a Victorian in the Mission in San Francisco in California in the United States. I am writing this on a Macbook Air..... and that's not going anywhere. I can't start from a literal description of my surroundings and move to writing about more abstract topics. This would be a good prompt if I was the sort of person who had difficulty abstracting, but it's more the details that give me pause. That's why I need to write. I know that thinking-with-a-keyboard for me is a different act than "thinking" alone, with different results. I repeat my own thoughts compulsively, and I need a record of the last thing I thought in order to move forward. 

I also think it would help me to stop ruthlessly navel-gazing. I constantly make the same mistake as Freud: I base my assessment of people in the abstract based on a small sample set consisting mostly of *the insane* (I should have finished that Foucault book.). 

When my thinking *is* effective, I'm generally predicting and not ruminating/analyzing. So maybe what I should be writing is hypothetical scenarios involving myself.

Hypothetical Scenario #1: July 4th, 2014-- A day in the life of J Eikens, 25.

You (let's go wih second person here) wake up at around 8, when the sun flitting through the floor-length windows onto my patio on my king-sized temperpedic mattress. <Material details are good for planning my spending in the future, if a little lame in prose>. You're not anxious at all, despite being psychomed-free. You put water on to boil for coffee and stretch out, not in the disorganized, spacey way you do when you're smoking pot daily, but as if, hypothetically, you, J Eikens, 25, had executive planning skills whose scope extended beyond the next 15 seconds. When the coffee is done you pour yourself a cup, and put a couple drops of half-and-half in it, because you have a well-stocked fridge full of minor things like half-and-half that make you feel safe and protected when you remember that you have them. 
You sit on your meditation mat amongst your awesome plants, and meditate for half an hour. It's not a struggle-- it's something you do for yourself because you want to and you always get what you want. 
You're working at home today-- fuck those clowns at E La Carte!!! j.k., you've actually developed at least semi-meaningful with your co-workers, and if you don't completely get along all the time you don't mind working with them. In practice, working at home for you means coding without distraction while your coffee buzz lasts, and then leaving and doing something else. You're not thinking of something else though. You can focus on your work without interruption while you're doing it. And after a year of working at E La Carte, you've seen most of the code, and you're a pretty good dev. Not a-maze-ing , but much more familiar with the process and productive, at least. You're developing the Android client for the new tablet in Clojure, because it's fun and you want to and you always get what you want. You are out to everyone in the office (or in your whole life) c
