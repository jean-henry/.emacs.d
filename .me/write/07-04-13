It is the Fourth of July, and I am sitting in the subletted room of a five-year-old in a Victorian in the Mission in San Francisco in California in the United States. I am writing this on a Macbook Air..... and that's not going anywhere. I can't start from a literal description of my surroundings and move to writing about more abstract topics. This would be a good prompt if I was the sort of person who had difficulty abstracting, but it's more the details that give me pause. That's why I need to write. I know that thinking-with-a-keyboard for me is a different act than "thinking" alone, with different results. I repeat my own thoughts compulsively, and I need a record of the last thing I thought in order to move forward. 

I also think it would help me to stop ruthlessly navel-gazing. I constantly make the same mistake as Freud: I base my assessment of people in the abstract based on a small sample set consisting mostly of *the insane* (I should have finished that Foucault book.). 

When my thinking *is* effective, I'm generally predicting and not ruminating/analyzing. So maybe what I should be writing is hypothetical scenarios involving myself. Preferably positive ones. I need to exercise my positive visualization skills, and I need to have a clear image in my mind of a what a me being in a good place could be like, so I can hold on to it when I'm not there, and point myself in the right direction.

Hypothetical Scenario #1: July 4th, 2014-- A day in the life of J Eikens, 25.

    You (let's go wih second person here) wake up at around 8, when the sun flitting through the floor-length windows onto my patio on my king-sized temperpedic mattress. <Material details are good for planning my spending in the future, if a little lame in prose>. You're not anxious at all, despite being psychomed-free. You put water on to boil for coffee and stretch out, not in the disorganized, spacey way you do when you're smoking pot daily, but as if, hypothetically, you, J Eikens, 25, had executive planning skills whose scope extended beyond the next 15 seconds. When the coffee is done you pour yourself a cup, and put a couple drops of half-and-half in it, because you have a well-stocked fridge full of minor things like half-and-half that make you feel safe and protected when you remember that you have them. 
You sit on your meditation mat amongst your awesome plants, and meditate for half an hour. It's not a struggle-- it's something you do for yourself because you want to and you always get what you want. 

    You're working at home today-- fuck those clowns at E La Carte!!! j.k., you've actually developed at least semi-meaningful with your co-workers, and if you don't completely get along all the time you don't mind working with them. In practice, working at home for you means coding without distraction while your coffee buzz lasts, and then leaving and doing something else. You're not thinking of something else though. You can focus on your work without interruption while you're doing it. And after a year of working at E La Carte, you've seen most of the code, and you're a pretty good dev. Not a-maze-ing , but much more familiar with the process and productive, at least. You're developing the Android client for the new tablet in Clojure, because it's fun and you want to and you always get what you want. You are out to everyone in the office (or in your whole life), and you worry about gender the way you used to only once in a while, when you're in a slump. You sure as hell aren't thinking about it right now.

    We won't go into further detail about what you did for work because you did a predictably good job and got done quickly. You decide to meet your friend at a sewing workshop in SOMA. After you earned enough at your job to stock your apartment, and paid off the money you owed, you spent a lot on your transition-- buying nice clothes, the tasteful kind that adults wear, facial hair removal, etc. Now you have a more developed sense of personal style, and you're starting to sew your own clothes. You're getting pretty good at it, because you want to be good at it, and you always get what you want.(I should elaborate on this, I've said it several times now: there's no arrogance or sense of entitlement about it, you simply understand and respect your own desires. You've stopped fearing them, because they don't typically involve hurting other people or putting them second. In fact, you treat other people a lot better now that you're not wasting your energy trying to repress yourself all the time. Win-win!) The friend you're meeting, F, is probably queer-- you've met a lot of other trans and queer people, and their perspective has helped you let go of your irrational gender hang ups and not think about them. You spend a few hours at the sewing workshop, finishing a skirt you've been working on. You're starting to experiment with automated pattern making, using 3D scans from devices like the Kinect to make clothes that fit precisely to your body. Learning the geometry and 3D modeling was tricky, but you're now able to make clothes that look brilliantly tailored. You've talked about spinning it into a business with Alex, and you've set up a few meetings with VCs who seem very interested. You've got a visually impressive product and a clear narrative for the company. With a little luck and effort, you should be able to get enough seed funding to quit at E La Carte and work on something that you're passionate about.

    You take your garments home, change into biking gear, and ride through Golden Gate Park and up through Marin County. You bike 3-5 days a week, and your ass looks great! While you ride, you think about work and your plans for the next few months. You've got SRS scheduled in the fall, and you're super excited, as is your boyfriend. BF is a bi artist/designer type who is comfortable enough in his masculinity and sexuality that he doesn't have weird hang-ups about your body. He thinks you're beautiful, and he doesn't mind your penis, per se, but you both agree that your sex will get a lot hottter once it's out of the way. (You still have pretty hot sex, though.) He is passionate and well-read and everything you'd want out of a man (mostly, he's not perfect), and he has an aesthetic that is both beautiful and completely unlike your own. You and BF do crafty projects together, and inspire each other.
