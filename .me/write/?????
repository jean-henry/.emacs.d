A question-and-answer session between ??????????, the personification of my self-disparaging aspects, and !!!!!!!!!!!, my enthusiastic, yet patient personal advocate. 
??????????: Are you really, REALLY trans? Or just lying, to get attention. Maybe you're actually subconsciously a pedophile, or have an Electra Complex (those are opposites, but that doesn't mean that the worst-case scenario can't include both!), or something weird like that, and you just say you're trans as a defense mechanism. Blah blah blah Freud blah. Maybe you're actually just a horny, dirty man who is a narcissist and so in love with HIMself that he wanted to turn himself into a woman so he could cut out the middle-woman and devote himself to self-love. Maybe you're just gay and you can't accept it. Who knows? With all of these compellingly believable alternatives, why would you *really* be trans? 
!!!!!!!!!!: I've thought(read: worried) about this one for so long that from a game theory perspective the optimal believed answer for me would be "yes" even if there was a perfect trans-litmustest simply because I'm happier believing that regardless of what's actually true, a la Pascal's Wager. Beyond that, yes, I am really, REALLY trans. That doesn't make me a girl, it doesn't even mean that I want to be a girl (to steal a phrase from Tiffany (???) in The Aggressives), it just means that I'm trans. I know how I feel, and I've felt that way for a long time. Everyone has their own idiosyncratic and largely unspoken definition of womanhood, and for every characteristic that is essential to someone's idea of what a woman is, there's a woman out there who doesn't have it.
With that said, here's a list of ways in which I am stereotypically female(according to others' stereotypes, not necessarily mine):
     - I don't like playing or watching most sports.
     - I like to decorate,cook, <insert domestic task here>.
     - Most of my friends are girls.
     - I'm a high S(like Sarah... remember Zitter office D/s personality quiz?), and I like it when people tell me what to do. IFF i think they know what they're doing. 
     - etc
But writing this list only makes me feel guilty for entertaining those stereotypes in the first place. I know that thinking in those terms doesn't do justice to most women, if any, so it's brutal and hypocritical to apply them to myself. 
I think I'll be happier when I present to the world more as a female than a male, although I'm going to resist pigeonholing myself on either end of the gender pigeon array. Given what other transwoman say post-transititon (usually, at least for young transitioners, "Do it!" ), statistics, and my own understanding of myself, I'm probably right about that. 
If there's one thing before others that I think I deserve, it's happiness. I haven't really been happy a whole lot, and some people would have me believe they feel that way all the time. 

??????????: You believe conventional, stereotypical, and simplistic belief X. You dirty, naughty human, you!
!!!!!!!!!!: This one came up in my mind (or to be precise: your mind, ????????) as I was writing he response to the previous one, and defending my femininity by resorting to female stereotypes
